# Interactive Recipe Book (WIP)
An automatic meal planner with shopping list created for use on volunteer youth camps.

This rudimentary excel program is an easy-to-use, no coding experience needed interactive recipe book which aims to streamline the process of creating large-scale catering menus and shopping lists. This file is hosted on Excel Live to allow for up-to-date use, no matter your location. 

This barebones 'program' means future volunteers can update the recipe database with absolutely no coding experience. Additionally, this program is able to be run on any Windows or MacOS computers.
